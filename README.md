# UTA-Campus-map

An application developed using open source software such as QGIS in which the shortest path is calculated between two buildings on university campus. First of all, map of the university is prepared using Google Earth and then represented in QGIS. In addition to shortest path, Google Street View and nearest neighbor analysis is also implemented. Thus, depending on the profile of user whether a student or faculty, he is shown the nearest parking lot from a particular building based on user profile.
